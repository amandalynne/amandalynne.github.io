# Hello

Welcome to my homepage. I am a PhD student in the [Department of Linguistics](https://linguistics.washington.edu) at the University of Washington. My research involves natural language processing for information extraction from scientific text, primarily in the biomedical domain. Please visit my academic website [here](https://linguistics.washington.edu/people/amandalynne-paullada).  

I am currently a research assistant to [Prof. Trevor Cohen](http://bime.uw.edu/faculty/trevor-cohen/), investigating vector space methods for representing relationships between biomedical entities from text.
Previously, I have been a research intern on the [Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/) team at the [Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence](https://allenai.org/). In 2018, I was a Student Fellow in the [Data Science for Social Good](https://escience.washington.edu/dssg/) program at the [UW eScience Institute](https://escience.washington.edu/). You can read about our project, the Seattle Mobility Index, [here](https://escience.washington.edu/2018-data-science-for-social-good-projects/).
