# About me

My professional and academic history are available in my resume and curriculum vitae, so this page is where you'll find miscellaneous biographical information.

I am a native of Los Angeles, CA. Family and friends have often drawn me to Seoul, Korea, St. Paul MN, Chicago IL, Dallas TX, San Francisco CA, and Boston MA.  
My favorite things to eat are generally spicy and/or fermented. I also love a good fresh radish or carrot.  
After a year and a half of living in Seattle, I still don't have fenders on my bike. I'll get around to it.
